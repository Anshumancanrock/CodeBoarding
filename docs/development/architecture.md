## Details

The system's main flow begins with the `API Service` receiving external requests, which then invokes the `Orchestrator`. The `Orchestrator` acts as the central coordinator, first initiating the `Static Analyzer` to perform code analysis and build foundational data structures. Subsequently, it passes this data to the `AI Interpretation Engine`, a suite of specialized AI agents that interpret the analysis and generate architectural insights. Finally, the `Orchestrator` directs the `Output Generator` to convert these insights into human-readable formats, with the final report being returned back through the `Orchestrator` to the `API Service`.

### API Service [[Expand]](./API_Service.md)
Serves as the primary entry point for all external interactions. It exposes the system's capabilities, handling incoming requests and returning the final generated analysis.

## Details

The CodeBoarding system operates as a multi-stage agentic pipeline designed to analyze project codebases. The process begins with the `PlannerAgent`, which establishes an initial analysis plan. This plan is then executed by the `AbstractionAgent`, responsible for synthesizing architectural components and their relationships. The `ValidatorAgent` subsequently ensures the correctness and integrity of the generated architectural insights. Throughout these stages, various `ToolingAgent` instances are leveraged to perform granular analysis tasks, providing essential data. The entire agentic framework is built upon the `CodeBoardingAgent`, an abstract base class that provides core functionalities and a standardized approach for LLM interactions, state management, and initialization. Recent significant updates to `CodeBoardingAgent` indicate an evolution of this foundational framework, impacting the interfaces and expected behaviors of all specialized agents.

## Details

The previous analysis lacked specific source code references for several key components, hindering the verification of their implementation boundaries and responsibilities. This revised analysis addresses those gaps by identifying the relevant code artifacts. The `Orchestrator`, embodied by `MetaAgent`, initiates the analysis process, leveraging various tools to gather initial project context. The `Static Code Analyzer`, primarily through the `Scanner` class, performs in-depth code analysis. The `AI Analysis Engine` (likely represented by `AbstractionAgent` and `DetailsAgent`) interprets these results, generating higher-level insights. `Analysis Persistence` (potentially handled by `AnalysisResult` and related mechanisms for storing data in the `.codeboarding` directory) ensures that all analysis data is stored and retrievable. Finally, the `Output Generator` (whose specific implementation needs further investigation but likely interacts with the stored analysis data to produce reports) transforms the processed data into user-friendly formats.

### Orchestrator [[Expand]](./Orchestrator.md)
Acts as the central coordinator of the analysis pipeline. It manages the sequence of operations, directing the flow of data between the various components to ensure the end-to-end process runs smoothly.

## Details

The CodeBoarding system is designed to provide comprehensive code analysis and insights, primarily driven by an AI Agent. At its core, the system leverages a Static Analyzer subsystem to generate detailed structural and relational data about the codebase, including call graphs and package dependencies. This rich static analysis data is then consumed by the Agent component, which acts as an intelligent orchestrator. The Agent utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning and decision-making, and interacts with the codebase through a suite of Agent Tools. These tools allow the Agent to dynamically query source code, file structures, and the static analysis results, enabling it to answer complex questions, identify architectural patterns, and provide actionable insights.

### Agent
The central orchestrator of the AI-driven analysis. It interprets user prompts, leverages a Large Language Model for reasoning, and coordinates the use of various specialized tools to interact with the codebase and static analysis data.
