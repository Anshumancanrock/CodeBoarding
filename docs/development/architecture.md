## Details

The system is built around a FastAPI Application that serves as the central entry point for all client interactions. It exposes Job Creation Endpoints for initiating new code analysis and documentation generation tasks, and Job Status Retrieval Endpoints for monitoring their progress and fetching results. All job-related data is managed persistently through DuckDB CRUD Operations. When a job is created, the Job Creation Endpoints initiate a Job Processing Background Task to handle the heavy computational work asynchronously. This background task interacts with the DuckDB CRUD Operations to update job statuses and store results. Depending on the job type, it may also invoke the Diagram Generator for visual documentation or the Output Generation Engine for other analysis outputs. The Job Data Model ensures consistent data structures and validation across the entire system.

### FastAPI Application

## Details

The system is orchestrated by the `Orchestration Engine`, which manages the end-to-end process of generating documentation. This engine interacts with `External Interfaces` to initiate jobs and persists job status in the `Job Database`. For code analysis, it delegates to the `Repository Manager` to access source code, which is then fed into the `Static Analysis Engine`. The `Static Analysis Engine` performs in-depth structural and semantic analysis, with recent updates significantly enhancing its internal logic and capabilities for extracting richer code insights. The results from static analysis are then passed to the `AI Interpretation Layer` for generating high-level insights and content. Subsequently, the `Diagram Generation Service` creates visual representations, and the `Output Generation Engine` compiles the final documentation. The CodeBoarding system is structured around an `Orchestration Engine` that manages the entire documentation generation workflow. This engine is initiated via `External Interfaces` and maintains job states in a `Job Database`. It delegates core tasks to specialized components: the `Repository Manager` for code retrieval, and the `Static Analysis Engine` for in-depth code analysis. The `Static Analysis Engine`, recently enhanced for more sophisticated analysis, feeds its findings to the `AI Interpretation Layer`. This layer processes the analysis to generate documentation content and insights, which are then used by the `Diagram Generation Service` for visual representations and the `Output Generation Engine` for final documentation production.

## Details

The system's architecture is centered around the generation of comprehensive architectural documentation from source code. The process begins with the Static Analysis Engine, which meticulously scans the codebase to extract raw architectural insights. These insights are then fed into the Output Generation Engine, the central orchestrator that manages the overall documentation workflow. The Output Generation Engine dispatches the insights to various specialized generators: HTMLGenerator, MarkdownGenerator, MDXGenerator, and SphinxGenerator, each responsible for producing documentation in its respective format. The HTML Template Populator further refines the HTML output by integrating generated data into predefined templates. Additionally, the GitHubActionOutputFormatter ensures that the generated documentation is appropriately formatted for seamless integration into GitHub Actions workflows, leveraging the capabilities of the other generators. This structured approach ensures accurate, consistent, and versatile architectural documentation.

### Static Analysis Engine [[Expand]](./Static_Analysis_Engine.md)

## Details

The static analysis subsystem orchestrates the extraction of comprehensive code insights. It begins with the `ProjectScanner`, which identifies programming languages and their associated LSP server configurations using an external scanning tool. This initial data is then consumed by the `LSPClient`, a generic component responsible for managing communication with Language Server Protocol servers. For specific languages like TypeScript, the `TypeScriptClient` extends `LSPClient` to handle language-specific configurations. Both `LSPClient` and `TypeScriptClient` perform detailed static analysis, extracting symbols, call graphs, and class hierarchies, and then populate the `StaticAnalysisResults` component, which serves as the central repository for all aggregated analysis data.

### ProjectScanner
Initiates the static analysis process by leveraging the external `tokei` tool to scan the project repository. It identifies programming languages used, their code distribution, and relevant file suffixes. Crucially, it also determines the appropriate Language Server Protocol (LSP) server commands for each detected language, preparing a structured list of `ProgrammingLanguage` objects. This component acts as the initial data gatherer, providing the necessary configuration and language-specific details for subsequent LSP-based analysis.

### LSPClient
Serves as the generic Language Server Protocol client. It manages the communication lifecycle with an LSP server (initialization, sending requests, receiving responses, shutdown). It orchestrates the detailed static analysis for individual files and the entire workspace, extracting symbols, imports, call graphs, and class hierarchies. It populates the `StaticAnalysisResults` with its findings.

### TypeScriptClient
A specialized implementation of `LSPClient` tailored for TypeScript projects. It handles TypeScript-specific initialization parameters, workspace configuration (e.g., processing `tsconfig.json`), and file discovery, ensuring the LSP server is correctly set up for TypeScript analysis. This component exemplifies the extensibility of the static analysis engine for different programming languages and also populates `StaticAnalysisResults`.

### StaticAnalysisResults
This central component acts as a repository for all aggregated static analysis results across different programming languages. It collects and manages various types of analysis data, including class hierarchies, control flow graphs, package dependencies, and source code references, provided by the LSP clients. It offers methods to add and retrieve these structured results for downstream processing and consumption.

## Details

The CodeBoarding system operates through a robust, multi-layered architecture designed for comprehensive code analysis and documentation generation. The API Service serves as the primary external interface, initiating jobs and managing user interactions. All job lifecycle and status information is persistently stored and managed by the Job Database. The Orchestration Engine acts as the central coordinator, driving the entire documentation pipeline. It interacts with the Repository Manager to retrieve source code and then dispatches requests to the Static Analysis Engine. The Static Analysis Engine performs deep, language-specific analysis, now providing richer and more detailed structural information. This enhanced data is then fed by the Orchestration Engine to the AI Interpretation Layer. This layer, comprising specialized AI agents, performs sophisticated interpretation, generating enhanced high-level architectural insights, and may query the Repository Manager for diff analysis. Finally, the Orchestration Engine passes these refined insights to the Output Generation Engine, which transforms them into various documentation formats with enhanced capabilities, including integration with GitHub Actions, before delivering the final output back through the API Service. This updated architecture reflects significant internal enhancements in analysis depth and output quality, particularly within the AI interpretation and static analysis components.
