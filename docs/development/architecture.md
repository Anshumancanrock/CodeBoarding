## Details

The system's architecture is centered around an AI Interpretation Layer orchestrated by the Meta Agent. This layer processes raw code data and repository information, provided by the Static Analysis Engine Component and Repository Management Component, respectively. A suite of Specialized AI Agents (including Abstraction, Details, Planner, Validator, and Diff Analyzer agents) performs targeted analysis under the Meta Agent's guidance. Their diverse outputs are then collected and standardized by the Agent Response Handler, which acts as a crucial intermediary before insights are passed to the Output Generation Layer for producing architectural diagrams and comprehensive documentation. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, from data acquisition and intelligent analysis to structured output generation.

## Details

The system's architecture is centered around the `Repository Manager`, which provides foundational access to source code repositories through its `Repository Operations Handler` and `Git Diff Extractor` sub-components. Building upon this foundation, the `Agent Orchestrator` acts as the primary intelligence layer, consuming repository data to drive complex processing workflows. It leverages the `Static Analyzer` to perform in-depth code analysis, receiving structured results that inform its decision-making and response generation. This integrated approach allows for sophisticated analysis and intelligent interaction with the codebase, with the `Agent Orchestrator` serving as the central coordinator for both repository interactions and static analysis.

### Repository Manager [[Expand]](./Repository_Manager.md)
This is the top-level component responsible for orchestrating all interactions with source code repositories. It provides a unified interface for the rest of the system to access repository functionalities, including cloning, checking out versions, and initiating diff operations. It acts as a facade, delegating specific tasks to its sub-components.

### Repository Operations Handler
Manages the fundamental, low-level operations related to local Git repositories. This includes cloning repositories from remote URLs, sanitizing repository URLs, verifying the existence of remote repositories, checking out specific branches or commits, and retrieving essential repository metadata (e.g., current commit hash, branch name). It also handles authentication tokens and the uploading of generated materials.

## Details

The static analysis subsystem is designed to systematically extract comprehensive code intelligence from a project. It starts with the `ProjectScanner` component, which is responsible for initial project introspection and file identification. The identified files are then handed over to language-specific analysis clients, primarily the `LSPClient` and its specialized extension, `TypeScriptClient`. These clients leverage the Language Server Protocol to perform deep static analysis, generating detailed insights into the codebase, such as call graphs, class hierarchies, and symbol references. All the generated analysis data is then consolidated and managed by the `StaticAnalysisResults` component, which acts as a central, language-agnostic repository for structured analysis outcomes, making them readily available for subsequent processing and consumption by other parts of the system.

### ProjectScanner
Initiates the static analysis process by scanning the project repository. It identifies relevant source files, determines programming languages used, and extracts basic project metadata. This component acts as the initial data gatherer, preparing the input for more detailed LSP-based analysis.

- <a href="https://github.com/CodeBoarding/CodeBoarding/blob/main/static_analyzer/scanner.py#L13-L66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`ProjectScanner`:13-66</a>


### LSPClient
Serves as the generic Language Server Protocol client. It manages the communication lifecycle with an LSP server (initialization, sending requests, receiving responses, shutdown). It orchestrates the detailed static analysis for individual files and the entire workspace, extracting symbols, imports, call graphs, and class hierarchies. It populates the `StaticAnalysisResults` with its findings.

### TypeScriptClient
A specialized implementation of `LSPClient` tailored for TypeScript projects. It handles TypeScript-specific initialization parameters, workspace configuration (e.g., processing `tsconfig.json`), and file discovery, ensuring the LSP server is correctly set up for TypeScript analysis. This component exemplifies the extensibility of the static analysis engine for different programming languages and also populates `StaticAnalysisResults`.

### StaticAnalysisResults
This central component acts as a repository for all aggregated static analysis results across different programming languages. It collects and manages various types of analysis data, including class hierarchies, control flow graphs, package dependencies, and source code references, provided by the LSP clients. It offers methods to add and retrieve these structured results for downstream processing and consumption.

## Details

The CodeBoarding system operates through a robust, multi-layered architecture designed for comprehensive code analysis and documentation generation. The API Service serves as the primary external interface, initiating jobs and managing user interactions. All job lifecycle and status information is persistently stored and managed by the Job Database. The Orchestration Engine acts as the central coordinator, driving the entire documentation pipeline. It interacts with the Repository Manager to retrieve source code and then dispatches requests to the Static Analysis Engine. The Static Analysis Engine performs deep, language-specific analysis, now providing richer and more detailed structural information. This enhanced data is then fed by the Orchestration Engine to the AI Interpretation Layer. This layer, comprising specialized AI agents, performs sophisticated interpretation, generating enhanced high-level architectural insights, and may query the Repository Manager for diff analysis. Finally, the Orchestration Engine passes these refined insights to the Output Generation Engine, which transforms them into various documentation formats with enhanced capabilities, including integration with GitHub Actions, before delivering the final output back through the API Service. This updated architecture reflects significant internal enhancements in analysis depth and output quality, particularly within the AI interpretation and static analysis components.
