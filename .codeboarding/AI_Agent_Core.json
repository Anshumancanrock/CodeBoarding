  "description": "The `AI Agent Core` component is fundamental because it establishes the base `CodeBoardingAgent` class, which is the foundation for all specialized agents within the system. This promotes consistency, reusability, and extensibility, aligning with the project's architectural bias towards modularity and clear separation of concerns. These components are fundamental because they represent a clear separation of concerns within an agent-based system. The `Core Agent Framework` provides the essential blueprint, `Agent Response Management` and `Agent Prompt Management` handle crucial communication aspects, `Specialized Analysis Agents` embody the system's intelligence, and the `Tooling Layer` provides the necessary interaction capabilities with the external environment. This modularity enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability, which are key architectural goals for an AI-powered software engineering tool.",
