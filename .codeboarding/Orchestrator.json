  "description": "The `CodeBoarding` project operates as an automated software architecture analysis system. The `Orchestrator` serves as the central control unit, initiating the analysis process by leveraging its `MetaAgent` to gather initial project metadata and establish architectural context. This context, along with raw code, is then fed to the `Static Code Analyzer`, which performs in-depth code analysis, extracting structural information and building essential data structures like call graphs. The results from the static analysis are then passed to the `AI Analysis Engine`, which, powered by sophisticated prompt engineering, interprets these findings and generates high-level architectural insights. All intermediate and final analysis data are diligently stored and managed by the `Analysis Persistence` component, ensuring data integrity and historical traceability. Finally, the `Output Generator` takes the processed analysis data and renders it into various user-friendly formats, including visual diagrams and comprehensive reports, making the complex architectural insights accessible to users. The `Orchestrator` also integrates with various tools like `read_docs`, `external_deps_tool`, and `read_file_structure` to enrich the analysis with external information.",
