  "description": "The `duckdb_crud` component serves as the central data management layer, offering CRUD operations for job records. It leverages the `duckdb library` for database functionalities and the `filelock library` to ensure data integrity during concurrent access. The `Job Orchestrator` acts as an external client, utilizing `duckdb_crud`'s services to manage the lifecycle of documentation generation jobs. All these interactions ultimately rely on the `File System` for persistent storage, with `duckdb_crud` directly interacting with the `os` module for file and directory management. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with `duckdb_crud` abstracting the complexities of database and file system interactions from the `Job Orchestrator`.",
