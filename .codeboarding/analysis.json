  "description": "The system operates by receiving requests through its API Service, which then delegates the analysis process to the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator coordinates the entire workflow, first invoking the Static Analyzer to gather foundational code data through language-aware static analysis. This data is then passed to the AI Interpretation Engine, where specialized AI agents process and interpret it to generate high-level architectural insights. Finally, the Output Generator transforms these insights into human-readable reports, which then returned through the Orchestrator back to the API Service.",
