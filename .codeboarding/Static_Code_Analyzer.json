      "description": "The Static Code Analyzer component is responsible for the initial, non-AI parsing of source code. It leverages Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based techniques to build foundational data structures such as ASTs, Call Graphs, and Structure Graphs. Its primary role is to transform raw code into a structured, machine-readable format, extracting essential code metadata that can then be interpreted and further processed by the AI analysis engine. This component is fundamental as it provides the structured input necessary for all subsequent AI-driven analysis.",
