  "description": "This document outlines the architecture of an AI-powered Software Engineering (AI4SE) tool, focusing on its core components and their interactions. The system is designed around an intelligent agent system pattern, where specialized AI agents perform distinct code analysis and documentation generation tasks, coordinated by a central orchestration unit. Key components include Specialized AI Agents, Core Agent Framework, Agent Orchestration Unit, Agent Tooling Layer, Static Analysis Engine, Data Management Layer, Output Generation Layer, and Repository Interaction Utilities. These components collectively form a robust, modular, and scalable architecture for complex code analysis and generation tasks.",
