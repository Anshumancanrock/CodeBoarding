## Details

The CodeBoarding architecture is designed for automated documentation generation, centered around an `Orchestration Engine` that manages the entire pipeline. User interactions are handled by the `API Service`, which initiates jobs stored in the `Job Database`. The `Repository Manager` provides source code and versioning information for analysis. The `Static Analysis Engine` performs deep, language-specific code analysis, now significantly enhanced with reference resolution capabilities, to extract comprehensive structural data. This detailed information is then processed by the `AI Interpretation Layer`, a suite of specialized AI agents operating on a refined and more robust framework, to generate high-level architectural insights. Finally, the `Output Generation Engine` transforms these insights into various documentation formats, including outputs for GitHub Actions, which are then delivered back to the user via the `API Service`.
