It encapsulates the generic Language Server Protocol (LSP) communication, managing the lifecycle of an LSP connection (initialization, request/response handling, shutdown). It provides methods for sending various LSP requests (e.g., for document symbols, call hierarchies, class hierarchies, references, definitions) and processing the server's responses to extract raw code insights. It also handles file filtering and directory exclusion.",
