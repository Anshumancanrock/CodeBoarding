  "description": "The CodeBoarding system is designed to provide comprehensive code analysis and insights, primarily driven by an AI Agent. At its core, the system leverages a Static Analyzer subsystem to generate detailed structural and relational data about the codebase, including call graphs and package dependencies. This rich static analysis data is then consumed by the Agent component, which acts as an intelligent orchestrator. The Agent utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning and decision-making, and interacts with the codebase through a suite of Agent Tools. These tools allow the Agent to dynamically query source code, file structures, and the static analysis results, enabling it to answer complex questions, identify architectural patterns, and provide actionable insights.",
