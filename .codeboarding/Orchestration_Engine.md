## Details

The system is designed around a central `Orchestration Engine` that coordinates the entire documentation and diagram generation process. This engine is activated by `External Integrations` and manages job states through the `Job Database`. It retrieves source code via the `Repository Manager` and then delegates complex code understanding to the `Analysis Layer`, which encompasses static analysis, AI interpretation, and diagram-specific data extraction. Once analysis is complete, the `Orchestration Engine` directs the `Output Generation Engine` to format and produce the final documentation and visual diagrams. Underlying this operational flow, the `Build and Deployment Infrastructure` ensures the project's proper assembly, dependency management, and distribution, providing the foundational support for all runtime components.

### Orchestration Engine [[Expand]](./Orchestration_Engine.md)
The central control subsystem responsible for initiating, managing, and coordinating all analysis and documentation generation jobs, acting as the primary orchestrator for the end-to-end workflow.
