## Details

The CodeBoarding system is structured around an Orchestration Engine that manages the entire documentation generation workflow. This engine is initiated via External Interfaces and maintains job states in a Job Database. It delegates core tasks to specialized components: the Repository Manager for code retrieval, and the Static Analysis Engine for in-depth code analysis. The Static Analysis Engine feeds its findings to the AI Interpretation Layer. This layer processes the analysis to generate documentation content and insights, which are then used by the Diagram Generator for visual representations and the Output Generation Engine for final documentation production.

### Orchestration Engine [[Expand]](./Orchestration_Engine.md)
The central control unit that manages the entire documentation generation pipeline, coordinating all analysis and generation stages. It initiates and oversees analysis jobs, and acts as the central coordinator, directing the flow of data and control between other components.
