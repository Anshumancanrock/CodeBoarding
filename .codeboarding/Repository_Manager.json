  "description": "The system's core functionality revolves around analyzing code changes. The `Git Operations Utility` serves as the foundational layer, providing raw repository data and diffs to the `Diff Analyzer`. The `Diff Analyzer` then processes this raw information, transforming it into structured code artifacts and contextual data. These processed outputs are subsequently routed to two distinct downstream components: the `Static Analysis Engine` for identifying code quality and security issues, and the `AI Interpretation Layer` for advanced, AI-driven insights and recommendations based on the code changes. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with the `Diff Analyzer` acting as a central hub for preparing data for specialized analysis.",
