  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the `Repository Manager`, which provides foundational access to source code repositories through its `Repository Operations Handler` and `Git Diff Extractor` sub-components. Building upon this foundation, the `Agent Orchestrator` acts as the primary intelligence layer, consuming repository data to drive complex processing workflows. It leverages the `Static Analyzer` to perform in-depth code analysis, receiving structured results that inform its decision-making and response generation. This integrated approach allows for sophisticated analysis and intelligent interaction with the codebase, with the `Agent Orchestrator` serving as the central coordinator for both repository interactions and static analysis.",
