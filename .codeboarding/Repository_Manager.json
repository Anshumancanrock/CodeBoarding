  "description": "The core of the subsystem revolves around the `Diff Analyzing Agent`, which acts as the central orchestrator for analyzing code changes. Initiated by an external `Orchestration Engine`, the `Diff Analyzing Agent` delegates the task of generating raw diff data to the `Diff Generator`. The `Diff Generator`, in turn, interacts with the `Repository Access Layer` to retrieve the necessary version control information. Once the diff data is processed and analyzed by the `Diff Analyzing Agent`, the resulting insights and updates are then transmitted to the `Static Analysis Engine` for further, more in-depth code examination. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated components for managing the analysis workflow, generating diffs, and interacting with the repository.",
