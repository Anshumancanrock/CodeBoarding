  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the Agent Orchestrator, which manages the overall agent-based processing workflow. It interacts with the Repository Manager to handle all source code repository operations, including cloning, checking out, and extracting code differences. The Repository Manager in turn delegates specific tasks to the Repository Operations Handler for low-level Git commands and the Git Diff Extractor for detailed code change analysis. Once repository data is prepared, the Agent Orchestrator orchestrates the Static Analyzer to perform in-depth static analysis, identifying code patterns, building graphs, and extracting structural information. The Static Analyzer then returns its findings to the Agent Orchestrator, which uses these results to generate refined responses. This modular design ensures clear separation of concerns, with the Static Analyzer's internal mechanisms recently enhanced to provide more robust analysis capabilities.",
