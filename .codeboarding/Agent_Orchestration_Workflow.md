## Details

One paragraph explaining the functionality which is represented by this graph. What the main flow is and what is its purpose.

### Agent Orchestration & Workflow [[Expand]](./Agent_Orchestration_Workflow.md)
This component is the core orchestrator of the code understanding and onboarding platform. It manages the end-to-end workflow, from initiating code analysis to coordinating various AI agents and integrating their outputs to generate comprehensive documentation. It acts as the central nervous system, ensuring all sub-components work in harmony to achieve the project's goal.
