  "description": "The system operates with an Orchestration Engine at its core, initiating and managing all documentation generation jobs. This engine interacts with a Job Database to maintain job status and details. Code repositories are handled by the Repository Manager, which provides the necessary code for analysis. The Analysis Layer performs comprehensive code analysis, including static analysis and AI-driven interpretation, now significantly enhanced by a dedicated prompt management system for AI agents. The results from the Analysis Layer are then passed back to the Orchestration Engine, which directs them to the Output Generation Engine for final documentation and diagram creation. External systems can trigger these workflows through the External Integrations component. The entire system is supported by the Build and Deployment Infrastructure, ensuring its operational readiness.",
