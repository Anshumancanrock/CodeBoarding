  "description": "The system is orchestrated by the `Orchestration Engine`, which manages the end-to-end process of generating documentation. This engine interacts with `External Interfaces` to initiate jobs and persists job status in the `Job Database`. For code analysis, it delegates to the `Repository Manager` to access source code, which is then fed into the `Static Analysis Engine`. The `Static Analysis Engine` performs in-depth structural and semantic analysis, with recent updates significantly enhancing its internal logic and capabilities for extracting richer code insights. The results from static analysis are then passed to the `AI Interpretation Layer` for generating high-level insights and content. Subsequently, the `Diagram Generation Service` creates visual representations, and the `Output Generation Engine` compiles the final documentation. The CodeBoarding system is structured around an `Orchestration Engine` that manages the entire documentation generation workflow. This engine is initiated via `External Interfaces` and maintains job states in a `Job Database`. It delegates core tasks to specialized components: the `Repository Manager` for code retrieval, and the `Static Analysis Engine` for in-depth code analysis. The `Static Analysis Engine`, recently enhanced for more sophisticated analysis, feeds its findings to the `AI Interpretation Layer`. This layer processes the analysis to generate documentation content and insights, which are then used by the `Diagram Generation Service` for visual representations and the `Output Generation Engine` for final documentation production.",
