  "description": "The system is designed around a central Orchestration Engine that manages the entire documentation generation workflow. This engine initiates tasks, coordinates data flow, and delegates specialized operations to other core components. The API Service acts as the external interface, allowing users to trigger documentation generation. Once a request is received, the Orchestration Engine interacts with the Repository Manager to access the source code. The code is then passed to the Static Analysis Engine for initial parsing and data extraction. The extracted data is subsequently processed by the AI Interpretation Engine, which leverages AI models to generate high-level insights and summaries. Finally, the Output Generation Engine transforms the processed information into various documentation formats, including diagrams and reports. The Configuration Management component provides system-wide settings and parameters, ensuring the Orchestration Engine operates with the correct configurations.",
