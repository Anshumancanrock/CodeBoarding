## Details

The `local_app.py` file, identified as the `Application Orchestrator`, plays a central role in managing the application's core logic and flow. It acts as the entry point for user queries and coordinates the sequence of operations involving the `QueryProcessor`, `VectorStore`, `DocumentRetriever`, and `ResponseGenerator`. The significant changes in `local_app.py` indicate a revised workflow, potentially introducing new features or altering how existing components interact. The orchestrator is responsible for passing the user query to the `QueryProcessor` for embedding, then directing the `DocumentRetriever` to fetch relevant information from the `VectorStore`, and finally, providing the gathered context to the `ResponseGenerator` to formulate a response. The system's architecture is centered around an `Application Orchestrator` (inferred from `local_app.py`) that manages the end-to-end processing of user queries. Upon receiving a query, the `Application Orchestrator` first engages the `QueryProcessor` to embed the query. Subsequently, it directs the `DocumentRetriever` to query the `VectorStore` for relevant documents based on the embedded query. Once documents are retrieved, the `Application Orchestrator` forwards both the original query and the retrieved documents to the `ResponseGenerator` to formulate a coherent natural language response. This response is then returned to the `Application Orchestrator` for delivery to the user, establishing a clear, sequential flow for information processing and response generation.

### Application Orchestrator
Manages the overall application flow, coordinating interactions between `QueryProcessor`, `DocumentRetriever`, and `ResponseGenerator`. It receives user queries and delivers final responses.


**Related Classes/Methods**: _None_

### QueryProcessor
Handles incoming user queries, embeds them, and prepares them for similarity search.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `langchain_core.embeddings.Embeddings:embed_query`:100-110


### VectorStore
Stores and retrieves document embeddings based on similarity search.


**Related Classes/Methods**:
