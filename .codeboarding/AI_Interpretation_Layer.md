## Details

The system operates around an `Application Orchestrator` that manages the overall flow from user query to response. User queries are initially processed by the `QueryProcessor`, which embeds them for efficient retrieval from the `VectorStore`. The `DocumentRetriever` then fetches relevant documents, which are passed back to the `Application Orchestrator`. A key architectural enhancement is the introduction of the `PromptFactory`, which centralizes and standardizes the generation of prompts for various agents and language models. The `Application Orchestrator` and `ResponseGenerator` both leverage the `PromptFactory` to obtain optimized prompts, enabling the `ResponseGenerator` to craft natural language responses based on the query and retrieved documents, including specialized prompts for models like Gemini Flash. This structured prompt management significantly refines how the system interacts with large language models, ensuring consistency and adaptability.

### Application Orchestrator
Manages the overall application flow, coordinating interactions between `QueryProcessor`, `DocumentRetriever`, `ResponseGenerator`, and now leveraging the `PromptFactory` for agent prompt generation. It receives user queries and delivers final responses, adapting its agent coordination mechanisms due to recent core agent logic refactoring and the new prompt management system.
