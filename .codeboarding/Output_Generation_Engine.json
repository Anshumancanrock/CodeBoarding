  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around the generation of comprehensive architectural documentation from source code. The process begins with the Static Analysis Engine, which meticulously scans the codebase to extract raw architectural insights. These insights are then fed into the Output Generation Engine, the central orchestrator that manages the overall documentation workflow. The Output Generation Engine dispatches the insights to various specialized generators: HTMLGenerator, MarkdownGenerator, MDXGenerator, and SphinxGenerator, each responsible for producing documentation in its respective format. The HTML Template Populator further refines the HTML output by integrating generated data into predefined templates. Additionally, the GitHubActionOutputFormatter ensures that the generated documentation is appropriately formatted for seamless integration into GitHub Actions workflows, leveraging the capabilities of the other generators. This structured approach ensures accurate, consistent, and versatile architectural documentation.",
