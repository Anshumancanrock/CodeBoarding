  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around an API Gateway / Job Orchestrator that provides external access for initiating and managing documentation generation. This component interacts with a Job Management System to persist job states and results. Upon receiving a request, the API Gateway / Job Orchestrator triggers the Output Generation Engine, which orchestrates the entire documentation creation process. The Output Generation Engine first utilizes the Static Analysis Engine to extract architectural insights from the codebase. These insights are then passed to the Documentation Format Generators, a consolidated component responsible for producing documentation in various formats, including HTML, Markdown, MDX, and reStructuredText, and for integrating with platforms like GitHub Actions.",
