  "description": "The system is structured around a clear pipeline for automated documentation generation. The `API Gateway / Job Orchestrator` serves as the user-facing interface and job manager, delegating job persistence to the `Job Management System`. The core processing begins when the `Output Generation Engine` is triggered, which first consults the `Static Analysis Engine` for deep architectural insights, now significantly improved by robust reference resolution. These comprehensive insights then feed into the `Documentation Format Generators`, which, operating with a streamlined agent framework, produce the final documentation in various formats. This architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and adaptable system for extracting and presenting codebase knowledge.",
