  "description": "The system is designed around a core documentation generation workflow, initiated and managed by the `API Gateway / Job Orchestrator`. This component handles incoming requests and orchestrates the lifecycle of documentation generation jobs, relying on the `Job Management System` for persistent state management. The `Output Generation Engine` is central to the documentation process, leveraging the `Static Analysis Engine` to extract comprehensive architectural insights from the codebase. These insights are then fed to the `Documentation Format Generators`, which are responsible for producing the final documentation in various specified formats. The recent significant expansion of external dependencies, as indicated by changes in `setup.py`, suggests an enhancement of capabilities across these core components, particularly within static analysis, output formatting, and job orchestration, with new underlying utilities residing in the `Unclassified` component.",
