  "description": "The Output Generation Engine subsystem is responsible for transforming processed architectural insights into various documentation formats. It orchestrates specialized generators for HTML, Markdown, MDX, and Sphinx, ensuring that the insights are presented in a structured and accessible manner. The GitHubActionOutputFormatter then adapts these outputs for seamless integration into GitHub Actions workflows. This modular design allows for flexible and extensible documentation generation across different platforms and tools.",
