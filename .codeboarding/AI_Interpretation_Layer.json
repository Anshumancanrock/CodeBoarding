  "description": "The CodeBoarding project employs a multi-agent architecture orchestrated by the Orchestrator component (agents.agent.CodeBoardingAgent). This central component manages the entire analysis workflow, from initial project context establishment to the final validation of architectural insights. The process begins with the Orchestrator providing initial project context to the Metadata Analyzer, which then returns high-level project insights. Based on these insights, the Orchestrator directs the Analysis Planner to formulate a strategic analysis plan. For code changes, the Diff Analyzer processes raw diff data, providing focused information back to the Orchestrator. The Detailed Code Analyzer performs in-depth static analysis under the Orchestrator's guidance, generating comprehensive data. This detailed analysis is then fed to the Abstraction Engine, which synthesizes high-level architectural insights. Finally, the Validation Engine verifies these insights, reporting back to the Orchestrator to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the generated architecture.",
