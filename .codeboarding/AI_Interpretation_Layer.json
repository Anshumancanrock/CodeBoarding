  "description": "The system's architecture is centered around an AI Interpretation Layer orchestrated by the Meta Agent. This layer processes raw code data and repository information, provided by the Static Analysis Engine Component and Repository Management Component, respectively. A suite of Specialized AI Agents (including Abstraction, Details, Planner, Validator, and Diff Analyzer agents) performs targeted analysis under the Meta Agent's guidance. Their diverse outputs are then collected and standardized by the Agent Response Handler, which acts as a crucial intermediary before insights are passed to the Output Generation Layer for producing architectural diagrams and comprehensive documentation. This design ensures a clear separation of concerns, from data acquisition and intelligent analysis to structured output generation.",
