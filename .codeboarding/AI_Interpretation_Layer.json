  "description": "The recent architectural changes primarily involve a significant refactoring of core agent logic and an enhancement of static analysis capabilities. The refactoring in `agents/agent.py` suggests a simplification or re-organization of how agents are defined and interact, directly impacting the `Application Orchestrator`'s role in coordinating agents and the `QueryProcessor`'s utilization of agent logic. Concurrently, the `static_analyzer/reference_resolve_mixin.py` has been substantially expanded, bolstering the system's static analysis features within the `Unclassified` component. While this enhancement offers new potential, its direct integration into the primary data flow of `QueryProcessor` or `ResponseGenerator` is currently a potential rather than a confirmed critical interaction. The system's architecture is centered around an `Application Orchestrator` that manages the overall flow from user query to generated response. The `QueryProcessor` handles initial query processing and embedding, preparing data for the `VectorStore`, which serves as the central repository for document embeddings. The `DocumentRetriever` interfaces with the `VectorStore` to fetch relevant information, which is then passed to the `ResponseGenerator` for natural language output. Recent refactoring in core agent logic has streamlined how the `Application Orchestrator` coordinates agents and how the `QueryProcessor` utilizes agent-related functionalities. Additionally, the `Unclassified` component now encompasses significantly enhanced static analysis capabilities, offering potential for future integration into core processing pathways.",
