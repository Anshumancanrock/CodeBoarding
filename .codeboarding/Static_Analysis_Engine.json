  "description": "The static analysis subsystem is designed to systematically extract comprehensive code intelligence from a project. It starts with the `ProjectScanner` component, which is responsible for initial project introspection and file identification. The identified files are then handed over to language-specific analysis clients, primarily the `LSPClient` and its specialized extension, `TypeScriptClient`. These clients leverage the Language Server Protocol to perform deep static analysis, generating detailed insights into the codebase, such as call graphs, class hierarchies, and symbol references. All the generated analysis data is then consolidated and managed by the `StaticAnalysisResults` component, which acts as a central, language-agnostic repository for structured analysis outcomes, making them readily available for subsequent processing and consumption by other parts of the system.",
