  "description": "The system operates as a FastAPI application, local_app.py, which serves as the central orchestrator for generating documentation and diagrams from GitHub repositories. It manages job lifecycles, from creation and status tracking to the actual execution of static analysis and documentation generation. The ProjectScanner initiates the analysis by identifying programming languages and their configurations. Subsequently, specialized LSPClient implementations (like TypeScriptClient) perform detailed static analysis, populating the StaticAnalysisResults with structured data. Finally, the local_app.py processes these results to generate the desired documentation and diagrams.",
