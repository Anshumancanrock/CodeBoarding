  "description": "The static analysis subsystem orchestrates the extraction of comprehensive code insights. It begins with the `ProjectScanner`, which identifies programming languages and their associated LSP server configurations using an external scanning tool. This initial data is then consumed by the `LSPClient`, a generic component responsible for managing communication with Language Server Protocol servers. For specific languages like TypeScript, the `TypeScriptClient` extends `LSPClient` to handle language-specific configurations. Both `LSPClient` and `TypeScriptClient` perform detailed static analysis, extracting symbols, call graphs, and class hierarchies, and then populate the `StaticAnalysisResults` component, which serves as the central repository for all aggregated analysis data.",

This component acts as the initial data gatherer, providing the necessary configuration and language-specific details for subsequent LSP-based analysis.",
