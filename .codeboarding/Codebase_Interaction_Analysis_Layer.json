      "description": "This component provides a comprehensive suite of tools that specialized AI agents can utilize to interact with the codebase, retrieve information, and perform specific operations. It acts as the agents' primary interface to the project's source code, file system, and documentation. The tools abstract away the complexities of data retrieval, offering a simplified and consistent API for agents to access various types of code-related information. This component is fundamental because it directly empowers the AI agents to \"see\" and \"understand\" the code, which is essential for any AI4SE application.",
