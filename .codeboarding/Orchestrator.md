## Details

The previous analysis lacked specific source code references for several key components, hindering the verification of their implementation boundaries and responsibilities. This revised analysis addresses those gaps by identifying the relevant code artifacts. The `Orchestrator`, embodied by `MetaAgent`, initiates the analysis process, leveraging various tools to gather initial project context. The `Static Code Analyzer`, primarily through the `Scanner` class, performs in-depth code analysis. The `AI Analysis Engine` (likely represented by `AbstractionAgent` and `DetailsAgent`) interprets these results, generating higher-level insights. `Analysis Persistence` (potentially handled by `AnalysisResult` and related mechanisms for storing data in the `.codeboarding` directory) ensures that all analysis data is stored and retrievable. Finally, the `Output Generator` (whose specific implementation needs further investigation but likely interacts with the stored analysis data to produce reports) transforms the processed data into user-friendly formats.

### Orchestrator [[Expand]](./Orchestrator.md)
Acts as the central coordinator of the analysis pipeline. It manages the sequence of operations, directing the flow of data between the various components to ensure the end-to-end process runs smoothly. The `MetaAgent` within this component is specifically responsible for initial project metadata analysis, establishing architectural context, and guiding subsequent analysis steps.


**Related Classes/Methods**:



### Static Code Analyzer
Responsible for performing in-depth static analysis on the codebase. This involves parsing source code, building abstract syntax trees (ASTs), identifying code patterns, and extracting structural information without executing the code.


**Related Classes/Methods**:



### AI Analysis Engine
Integrates AI/LLM capabilities to interpret the results from the Static Code Analyzer and the architectural context provided by the Orchestrator. It generates high-level insights, identifies complex relationships, and provides explanations or suggestions based on the analyzed code.


**Related Classes/Methods**:



### Analysis Persistence
Manages the storage, retrieval, and versioning of all analysis-related data, including raw static analysis outputs, AI-generated insights, project metadata, and configuration settings. This ensures data integrity and enables historical analysis.


**Related Classes/Methods**:



### Output Generator [[Expand]](./Output_Generator.md)
Transforms the processed analysis data into various user-friendly formats, including visual representations (e.g., Mermaid.js diagrams for architectural views) and structured reports. It is responsible for rendering the final output for user consumption.
