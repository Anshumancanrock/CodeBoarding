  "description": "The CodeBoarding application is structured around a FastAPI Application that serves as the central orchestrator for all API interactions. This core component routes incoming requests to Job Creation Endpoints for initiating new code analysis and documentation generation tasks, and to Job Status Retrieval Endpoints for clients to monitor the progress and retrieve results of their submitted jobs. All data related to jobs, requests, and responses is consistently defined and validated by the Job Data Model. Persistent storage and retrieval of job records are handled by DuckDB CRUD Operations. Intensive computational work, such as code analysis and documentation generation, is asynchronously managed by the Job Processing Background Task. This background task coordinates the execution of these operations, updating job statuses, and leveraging specialized components like the Diagram Generator for visual outputs and the Output Generation Engine for other forms of analysis results. Recent significant updates to the core application logic in local_app.py have expanded the capabilities and refined the interactions within these central components, introducing new flows and enhancing existing functionalities.",
