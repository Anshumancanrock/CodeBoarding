  "description": "The system operates with a clear division of labor among its core AI agents. The `Planner Agent` initiates the process, strategically determining the necessary steps and information required for architectural interpretation. It orchestrates the activities of the `Abstraction Agent`, which is responsible for transforming raw code data into high-level architectural insights, and the `Validator Agent`, which ensures the accuracy and consistency of these insights. All agents leverage the `Agent Base/Core` component for fundamental functionalities and shared utilities, promoting a cohesive and extensible design. The `Toolkit` serves as the agents' primary interface to the codebase, providing a comprehensive set of specialized tools for data retrieval, including source code, file structures, and control flow graphs, enabling informed decision-making and analysis throughout the architectural interpretation workflow.",
