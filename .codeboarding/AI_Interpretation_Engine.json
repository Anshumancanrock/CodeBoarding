  "description": "The CodeBoarding system operates as a multi-stage agentic pipeline designed to analyze project codebases. The process begins with the `PlannerAgent`, which establishes an initial analysis plan. This plan is then executed by the `AbstractionAgent`, responsible for synthesizing architectural components and their relationships. The `ValidatorAgent` subsequently ensures the correctness and integrity of the generated architectural insights. Throughout these stages, various `ToolingAgent` instances are leveraged to perform granular analysis tasks, providing essential data. The entire agentic framework is built upon the `CodeBoardingAgent`, an abstract base class that provides core functionalities and a standardized approach for LLM interactions, state management, and initialization. Recent significant updates to `CodeBoardingAgent` indicate an evolution of this foundational framework, impacting the interfaces and expected behaviors of all specialized agents.",
